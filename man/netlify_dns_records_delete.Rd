\item{records}{DNS records to delete. A character vector of record identifiers or a dataframe/tibble with an \code{id} column. Further columns are silently
ignored.}

\item{domain}{Domain name to delete DNS records for. This is translated into the corresponding Netlify DNS Zone. A character scalar.}

\description{
Deletes DNS records on Netlify for the specified \code{domain} using the \href{https://open-api.netlify.com/#tag/dnsZone/operation/deleteDnsRecord}{\code{deleteDnsRecord}}
endpoint of \href{https://docs.netlify.com/api/get-started/}{Netlify's RESTful API}. DNS \code{records} must be provided as either a character vector of DNS record
identifiers or a dataframe/tibble with an \code{id} column. Further columns are silently ignored.
}
\details{
Supported are the DNS record types \code{A}, \code{AAAA}, \code{ALIAS}, \code{CAA}, \code{CNAME}, \code{MX}, \code{NS}, \code{SPF}, \code{SRV} and \code{TXT}. Netlify's own custom record
types \code{NETLIFY} and \code{NETLIFY6} cannot be altered via the API and must be configured via \href{https://app.netlify.com/}{Netlify's web interface}.
